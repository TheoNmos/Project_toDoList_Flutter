## to-do list using Flutter

This project is a simple but useful to-do list application.

The code is at the lib folder.

I made it to practice my programming skills and to learn more about the flutter framework.

The aplication is very basic but has some cool functionality to it. You can add tasks pretty easily amd delete them by swiping and clicking the button that is hidden behind the task, in case you remove a task b accident you can also undo it by simply clicking the button that appears on the screen.

The code is basically a List of widgets called "tasks" and for each component on the list it creates a task on the screen.

Here are some images for better understanding of the application: 

Image 1: Ilustrates how the app first opens. 
Image 2: Added 3 tasks by typing the task name at the textfield and pressing the '+' button.
Image 3: Deleting a task by swiping right and clicking the button that unfolds.
Image 4: After the task is deleted a dialog is shown on the screen asking if you want to undo the deletion of the previous task.
Image 5: If you want to, you can clear all the tasks. The image shows the dialog that the app shows to confirm the action.
