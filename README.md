## to-do list using Flutter

This project is a simple but useful to-do list application.

I made it to practice my programming skills and to learn more about the flutter framework.

The aplication is very basic but has some cool functionality to it. You can add tasks pretty easily amd delete them by swiping and clicking the button that is hidden behind the task, in case you remove a task b accident you can also undo it by simply clicking the button that appears on the screen.

The code is basically a List of widgets called "tasks" and for each component on the list it creates a task on the screen.

Here are some images for better understanding of the application:
